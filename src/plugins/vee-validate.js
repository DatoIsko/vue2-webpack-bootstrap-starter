/* ============
 * Vee Validate
 * ============
 * This is a plugin for Vue.js that allows you to validate input fields,
 * and display errors, in an easy and powerful way.
 * You don't have to do anything fancy in your app,
 * most of the work goes into the html.
 * You only need to specify for each input what kind of
 * validators should be used when the value changes.
 * You will then get informed of the errors for each field.
